# ThreeMusketeers Java Game README

## Overview
Welcome to ThreeMusketeers, a Java game inspired by a board game. Three Musketeers is played on a 5 x 5 square grid board. The bottom left corner, the center and the top right corner are starting spaces for the three musketeers. All other spaces are initially occupied by "enemies." Musketeers can only move to adjacent spaces with an enemy piece, which is captured by this move. Enemies can only move to empty adjacent spaces. Enemies win if all three musketeers are ever on the same line or column. Musketeers win as soon as they run out of legal moves.
